### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I picked a few focus areas for this app

1. Project Expectations: This was most important. I read over the assignment often to ensure I didn't miss anything and/or 
build something that wasn't allowed. As I was reading the assignment, I made a file called "todos.txt" to keep track of what 
was required and what goals I had while coding.

2. UX: Presentation matters a lot and I wanted to make something functional with a simple and pleasurable user experience. 
The design is functional but not perfect. So the emphasis was on self-explanatory features and their ease of use.

3. Filtering: I love building filters and wanted to expand on the suggested cuisine filtering

4. Featured recipe: Touching on the creativity aspect again, I wanted something modern and decided this minor feature could 
make the app feel real.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

Approximately 3 days since Monday the 17th. In order, I focused my time on ideation, rough design, development and
testing, and finally unit testing.

Note: I wasn't able to start the project when I first received it due to some personal time constraints. I
communicated this to my recruiter last week. Additionally, I got sick last week and also had an allergic reaction 
which prevented me from starting the project until this week. Because I was later than anticipated, I needed
to be above and beyond the requirements to make up for the lost time. My apologies for the delay.


### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

1. View Models & State Management: I decided to treat the view model as a store/global state rather 
than a true 1:1 view model. I chose this path to focus on building functionality quickly.

2. Native vs Custom Components/View: A few moments happened in which I wasted time by not building 
a custom component and there were moments where the built-in solution was better than a custom solution.

3. iOS 16:  If I had targeted a higher version of iOS, I would have 
implemented SwiftData to support recipe caching. This would "trim" the number of network requests.


### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

1. Naming conventions

2. Lack of SwiftData and/or CoreData

2. View Model configuration


### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

Looking forward to hearing back from the Fetch team! I will put up a video demo soon. Until then, thank you!
