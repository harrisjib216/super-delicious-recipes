Requirements
[+] Make app target ios 16
[+] Fetch recipes from the server
[+] Display a recipe's name, thumbnail, and cuisine (as the minimum)
[+] Add pull to refresh functionality
[+] Save recipe images to the disk
[+] Use async/await for concurrency
[+] No 3rd party dependencies
[+] Write tests for the app
[+] Use SwiftUI
    Note:
        Overall, I would say 95%+ of this app is written in SwiftUI
        
        The Launch Screen, WebView, and RecipeImage components have a small
        mixture of UIKit because this app targets an older version of iOS
        that cannot access newer api's from Apple.
